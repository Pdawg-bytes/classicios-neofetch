# classicios-neofetch
A patched version of neofetch for classic iOS. Fixes incorrect memory statistics and adds screen resolution values.

# Usage
On your iDevice, run `dpkg -i classicios-neofetch-patch.deb`. Then just run `neofetch`!

# It doesn't work!
You probably tried copying the script instead of installing the deb, so you're probably missing memtool. Download it [here](https://github.com/Pdawg-bytes/memtool-ios/releases). You may need to build memtool if it doesn't run on more modern devices. 
*Or just install the deb!*
